# Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning

In this workshop, we will see what are all the steps involved in making an Application Specific Intergrated Circuit(ASIC) from RTL to GDSII.

## Day-1
The field we are exploring involves the chips inside boards such as the Arduino board and the VSDSquadron. The image below shows Arduino board.

1.

The block diagram of the board, along with all its peripherals, can be found in the image below.

2.

Since we are dealing with only the central chip, if we open it, it will reveal the package with connections to the chip inside.

3.

Connections to and from the outside world occur through the I/O pads. The entire logic (netlist) is placed inside the core. The logic, along with the I/O pads, is referred to as the DIE. 

4.

The core is filled with various IPs and macros.
